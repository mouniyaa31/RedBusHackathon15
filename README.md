PROBLEM STATEMENT

Engineering students in India are often required to work with sensors in their coursework, and being able to collect and display sensor data can be a valuable
skill. To help students develop this skill, a software application needs to be built that can collect data from various sensors of a mobile device and display it in
a graphical user interface (GUI). The application should be able to run continuously without anyinterruptions, ensuring that data is collected and displayed accurately.

The development of this application will require a solid understanding of software engineering principles and expertise in developing user-friendly GUIs. The software
needs to be designed in such a way that it can handle the data from various sensors of a mobile device in a robust and efficient manner. This can be achieved by 
adopting best practices such as data compression and efficient data structures, ensuring that the application can handle the large amounts of sensor data that may 
be generated.

Furthermore, the software application should be designed with usability in mind, as it will be used by engineering students who may not have extensive experience in 
software development. The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear instructions and visual cues to help guide the user. Overall, the 
development of this application will be a valuable learning experience for engineering students in India, helping them to develop skills that are highly relevant 
in today's technology-driven world.
